   # Note Taker

   ## Description
   
   This project creates notes for a user. The notes are stored onto a local server using express.js. I wanted to make this app so that a user can create and save any notes they create.

   ## Installation

   ## Usage
   
  You would use this application by installing express.js package and then run npm start to start the server. Once the server is started a user can then go and create notes and save them.
   
  
Here is what it would look like when creating a new note.

Now the created note would appear here:

   ## Credits
   
    I want to give credit to my class TA(Jehyun Jung) as he helped me notice that my server wouldn't work correctely due to my filepath.
